BugChess
========

My friends and I enjoy playing a strategy game called Hive — think chess, but without a board and eminently more accessible to newcomers. Anyway, seeing as one of us was heading overseas for a few months, I wanted to come up with a way we could get our fix despite the vast distance between us. I also wanted to play around with HTML5, and as a result, “Bug Chess” was born.

It’s fully functioning, including a mediocre AI (that I hope to improve upon), but doesn’t have any sort of tutorial or anything (we all know how to play it already!). Anyway, the game is optimized for iPads and newer generation Android devices with good resolution, like the Samsung Galaxy. I recommend trying it on one of those, although it will work on a computer screen as well. Check it out yourself at http://www.loualicegary.com/bugchess.
